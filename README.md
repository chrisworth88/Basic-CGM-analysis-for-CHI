# Basic-CGM-analysis-for-CHI
This is the basic CGM analysis code for patients with CHI used to generate the data for the following paper: 
Worth C, Harper S, Salomon-Estebanez M, O'Shea E, Nutter P, Dunne M, Banerjee I
Clustering of Hypoglycemia Events in Patients With Hyperinsulinism: Extension of the Digital Phenotype Through Retrospective Data Analysis
J Med Internet Res 2021;23(10):e26957
URL: https://www.jmir.org/2021/10/e26957
DOI: 10.2196/26957

Since the publication of the paper the authors have spent significant time imrpoving the analysis code for CGM data.
In the interests of transparency the code publihsed here in the file "code" is the code that was used for the analysis to inform the above paper
If researchers/clinicians are interested in analysis of CGM data in patients with CHI then I would be delighted to discuss this and the most up to date methods.
Please contact me at chris.worth@mft.nhs.uk if this is the case and I would be delighted to help.
